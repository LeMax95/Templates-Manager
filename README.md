 ## <span style="font-size:larger;">Template Import Formats:</span>

Templates-Manager supports importing templates from Excel (XLSX) and TXT/CSV files. Please follow the specified formats for a smoothy import process:

- **Excel (XLSX):**
  Organize your Excel table into two columns. The first column should contain the titles, and the second column should contain the corresponding templates. The order can be either left to right or upside-down; the crucial aspect is the presence of two distinct columns. Here are examples for both formats:

  **Left-to-Right:**
  ```plaintext
  | Title   | Template Content         |
  |---------|--------------------------|
  | Title1  | Template content for Title1 |
  | Title2  | Template content for Title2 |
  | Title3  | Template content for Title3 |
  ```
  **Upside-Down:**
   ```plaintext
   Title3  
   Template content for Title3  
   Title2  
   Template content for Title2    
   Title1    
   Template content for Title1
   ```
- **TXT/CSV:** For TXT or CSV files, separate each template entry with an ampersand (`&`) sign. Each entry should start with an ampersand followed by the title and the template content. Here's an example:

```plaintext
&Title1  
Template content for Title1  
&Title2  
Template content for Title2  
&Title3  
Template content for Title3
```
