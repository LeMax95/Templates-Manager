# Templates-Manager

## Description
Templates-Manager is an efficient tool designed for managing text-based templates. It allows users to create, organize, and edit templates using a built-in Rich Text Format (RTF) redactor. The app is optimized for easy search and retrieval of templates, ensuring a seamless user experience. All templates are securely stored in the browser for quick access, and privacy is guaranteed.

## Key Features:
- **Quick Search and Copy:**  
   Retrieve templates with ease using the search feature. Enter at least two letters of the template title, and the app will dynamically match and present relevant results.
   
- **Efficient RTF Redactor:**  
   Create, edit, and manage your content with the built-in RTF editor.

- **Template Storage:**  
   Securely store your templates in the browser for quick access and easy retrieval.

- **Bulk Template Import:**  
   Add multiple templates at once from TXT or Excel files, simplifying the import process.

- **Backup and Restore:**  
   Safeguard your templates with the ability to back them up and restore them whenever necessary.

- **Location Spoofing:**  
   Generate random geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) for location simulation purposes.

- **Reports:**  
   The app generates detailed and summary reports of template interactions and usage statistics.

## Template Import Formats:
- **Excel (XLSX):**  
   For importing templates from Excel, arrange your data into two columns: the first column for the title and the second for the template content.

- **TXT/CSV:**  
   Use ampersands (`&`) to separate each template entry. Each entry should begin with an ampersand, followed by the title and template content.

### Example (Excel Format):
| Title    | Template Content          |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Title1   | Template content for Title1|
| Title2   | Template content for Title2|
| Title3   | Template content for Title3|

### Example (TXT/CSV Format):
```plaintext
&Title1  
Template content for Title1  
&Title2  
Template content for Title2  
&Title3  
Template content for Title3
```
